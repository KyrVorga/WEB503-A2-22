            <p>
                My biggest project is for Nimbus Software LTD. I am developing and documenting an API proof of concept for them. 
                This project is almost complete and I am currently working on the documentation and refining the code.
                <br>
                <br>
                In this project I have used the following technologies:
                <ul>
                    <li>NodeJS</li>
                    <li>Express</li>
                    <li>Javascript</li>
                    <li>JWT</li>
                    <li>Sequelize</li>
                    <li>MSSQL</li>
                    <li>Postman</li>
                    <li>Git</li>
                    <li>GitHub</li>
                </ul>
                Once I have completed the project I am going to take what I have learned and apply it to my own project.
                Keep an eye on the link below, currently it is a private repository but I will be making it public once I have made significant progress.
                It is a project that I have been thinking on for a while and I am excited to develop it.

                <h2 id="World">World Seed Calculator</h2>
                This application is a terminal based application written using NodeJS. 
                It is designed for the game World Seed, what the application does is take that 
                statistics of your character and calculate exactly what enemies are deadly to you.
                <br>
                The project is public on GitHub, but is still requiring some work to be done.

                For my software development class we were required to create a small calendar app 
                that can manipulate dates, a Minesweeper board generator, and a basic calculator.

                <h2 id="Old">My Old Projects</h2>
                This repo contains all of the code that I kept from my final year at Nayland College.
                 Some of the applications are still functional, but most of them are not. 
                 They are all written in Python, some being full-stack with Flask and SQLite3.

                <h2 id="Practice">My Practice and Snippets</h2>
                this repo contains all of the code that I have written for practice, or for snippets that I have used in other projects.
                It also contains some of the code that I have written for my assessments and written in class.
                There is also a large amount of code that I wrote as a part of the freeCodeCamp curriculum.
