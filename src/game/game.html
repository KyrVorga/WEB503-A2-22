			<h1 id="content-header">CGI and Game Development</h1>
			<p>
				I started doing game development as a hobby while I was studying
				at Nayland College. I've created a one fully functioning game,
				and one prototype of a game which I hope to develop further. I
				have had experience in Blender (one of the games uses blender
				models I made), I made three renders and one simulation. I can
				provide access to the two games upon request at
				Rhylei@aureate.dev.
			</p>
			<br />
			<h2 id="Shogi" class="header-topic">Shogi</h2>
			<p>
				The first of the games is Shogi. Shogi is effectively Japanese
				chess, there are many variants such as the board has 81 squares
				instead of 64, most pieces have far less movement compared to
				chess, pieces can be promoted into a stronger piece and pieces
				you take can be placed on the board as your own piece.
			</p>
			<p>
				This game was made using Blender for creating the models, Gimp
				for modifying textures and Unity as the game engine. The game
				uses mostly 4k textures with the exception being the board which
				uses an 8k texture.
			</p>
			<p>
				I first built this game a few years ago but lost the project
				files when I re-installed windows on my computer (I also lost
				the other game, and all the CGI projects ☹).
			</p>
			<img
				src="../../public/Shogi.png"
				alt="A shogi board being viewed from above"
				class="content-image"
			/>
			<p>
				I then re-created the game again in 2022, because I regretted
				losing the project and felt I could do a better job this time
				around (which I did!).
			</p>

			<br />
			<br />
			<h2 id="Slime" class="header-topic">The Wandering Slime</h2>
			<p>
				The second game is a prototype for a game I hope to develop, it
				is a 2D platformer where you play as a slime that jumps around.
				In it's current state there isn't any gameplay as my primary
				focus was on asset quality and the movement of the slime.
			</p>
			<video class="content-image" controls>
				<source src="../../public/Slime.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
			</video>
			<p>
				I had a lot of good feedback about this game, I was following a
				tutorial series that creates a platformer RPG, however I hand
				crafted every texture and animation. As with the Shogi game I
				lost the project files when I re-installed windows on my
				computer. I do stil have and export of the most recent version
				of the game. I plan to re-create this game in the future,
				starting by extracting what I can out of the export.
			</p>
			<br />
			<br />
			<h2 id="Renders" class="header-topic">Renders</h2>
			<p>
				I have also done these two renders, these are both done in
				Blender, with the assets sourced from elsewhere. The first
				render was made following a tutorial series, the second is what
				I attempted with the skills I had learned from the first render.

			<br />
			<h2 id="Simulation" class="header-topic">Simulation</h2>
			<p>
				I also made this simulation, it is a simulation of a light
				breeze through some tall grass, it was made in Blender. The
				breeze is extremley subtle, but I like it very much.
				Unfortunatley the .mp4 is too dense to display on this page, so
				I will provide it on request at Rhylei@aureate.dev
